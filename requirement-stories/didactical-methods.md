### Didactical method
**Depends on:**\
**Description:** A didactical method defines how subject matter is being taught. A didactical method can be active (students are actively working), passive (students are listening) or hybrid (combination of the two). Active methods can be weakly, average or strongly steered. A short description of how the didactical method works is needed. A didactical method can either acquire new competencies or train previously acquired competencies. It can also be able to cover one or more levels on the taxonomy of bloom.\

### Used didactical methods
**Depends on:**\
**Description:** A teacher uses one or more didactical methods to teach subject matter. He should be able to see which ones he used.\
**Priority:** 2

### Description of didactical methods
**Depends on:**\
**Description:** A teacher wants to make distinctions between different didactical methods to select the most appropriate and to have some variety. Important distinctions are: active/passive/hybrid, strongly/weakily/ none steering (active methods), if it's used to teach/repeat/deepen subject matter.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: direct instruction
**Depends on:** Description of didactical methods\
**Description:** Direct instruction is the most classic didactical method. The teachers explains, pupils listen, take notes and (are expected to) reason along with the teacher\
**Description:** 1

### Didactical method: classical exercises
**Depends on:** Description of didactical methods\
**Description:** In this didactical method, the teacher makes exercises together with the pupils. This is a passive method, but a less passive method than direct instruction for example.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: STEM projects
**Depends on:**\
**Description:** Some subjects require STEM projects. These usually span multiple lessons and have a greater end product that the pupils work towards. There are often intermediate goals that the pupils need to meet before going to the next part of the assignment. Pupils often get time during class to work on the project, but this is often  not enough (so pupils should finish it as homework).\
**Priority:** 2

### Exercise lesson: open, limited and closed
**Depends on:**\
**Description:** There are 3 ways to facilitate exercise lessons. An open lesson lets the pupils work individually on exercises. A limited means that pupils make exercises individually and afterwards, the teacher solves it for the whole class. A closed lesson is when the teacher makes the exercises together with the whole class.\
**Priority:** 2

### Didactical method: OLG
**Depends on:** Didactical methods\
**Description:** OLG (Onderwijsleergesprek in dutch) is a didactical method where the teacher asks questions to pupils to activate them. It is a strongly steering active method.\
**Priority:** 1

### Categorize didactical methods: active or passive
**Depends on:** Didactical methods\
**Description:** a usefull distinction to make between didactical methods, is whether it is active or passive. This is from the perspective of the learner: is the learner actively participating or is he more listening to the teacher?\
**Priority:** 1

### Categorize didactical methods: none, weakly or strongly steering
**Depends on:** Didactical methods, Exercise lesson: open, limited and closed\
**Description:** Active methods can be none, weakly or strongly steering. This describes how much a teacher has to steer the pupils. Passive methods are not really suited for this distinction\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: project based learning
**Depends on:** Didactical methods\
**Description:** An example of an active, weakly steering didactical method is working around a project. The pupils try to reach a goal in different steps. This can either be in group or individual. Usually one step has to be completed before starting on the next. Steps can be communicated by the teacher, or pupils need to figure out which steps to take (or a hybrid of the two)\
**Priority:** 2

### Balance exercise-theory
**Depends on:** Didactical methods\
**Description:** A teacher should get an overview of the balance theory-exercise: how many hours did he/she spend explaining subject matter and how many hours did pupils spend processing the subject matter on their own.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: ADI-model
**Depends on:** Didactical methods\
**Description:** The ADI-model is a didactical method where teachers give a short introduction to the subject matter (max 15 min). Then the pupils individually make exercises. They can choose from a whole range of exercises so that they can process the subject matter at their own pace and level.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: project based learning with theme
**Depends on:** Didactical method: project based learning\
**Description:** Some schools couple a theme to a project and in so, incorporate multiple subject matters into one big project. An example could be Global Warming. Students can learn the physics behind it, analyse the public debate, maybe watch an english documentary...\
**Priority:** 1

### teacher activity
**Depends on:**\
**Description:** Some teachers like to think about the activity of the teacher when teaching a class. It should be possible to add this to the lesson preparation.\
**Priority:** 3

### pupil activity
**Depends on:** \
**Description:** It could be usefull to explicitely state what pupils are doing during a lesson phase. This can be incroporated in the didactical method, or can be annotated on the lesson preparation itself.\
**Priority:** 3

### Description of didactical metods: training vs practice 
**Depends on:** Description of didactical methods\
**Description:** When starting on a new competency, pupils have to be trained at first. They see the theory and make introductory exercises. In later lessons, they practice the competency by making more (and more challenging) exercises. Whether a didactical method/lesson phase trains or practices a competency should be noted.\
**Priority:** 2

### Didactical method: Nando
**Depends on:** Didactical methods, ADI-Model\
**Description:** Nando is a didactical method that follows the ADI-model. It is designed for math pupils, but can be extrapolated to other subjects. After a short instruction, pupils make signaling exercises. Based on how they complete these exercises, the teacher can evaluate the level of a pupil and assign exercises accordingly. It also follow the BHV-model that accentuates the importance of distincting training exercises, practice exercises and enriching exercises.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: group projects with roles
**Depends on:** Didactical method, Project base learning\
**Description:** In this didactical method, the pupils make a project in groups. Every pupil has a role in the group it has to fulfill. Common roles are group leader, secretary, communication with external partner... Most of the available roles are dependent on the nature of the project: in informatics project there will be most likely a database administrator. For language projects, their could be a spelling responsability, researcher...\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: expert groups
**Depends on:** didactical method\
**Description:** The pupils are split up into groups. Every group researches a specific subject and teaches it to the other groups.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: research based learning
**Depends on:** didactical methods\
**Description:** Pupils need to answer questions without too much explanation from the teacher. This didactical method focusses on the ability to research a question/topic without a domain expert to help.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: peer teaching
**Depends on:** didactical methods\
**Description:** Pupils are split into small groups (2 or 3 pupils per group). One of them is the tutor and already knows the subject matter quiet well. He/she teaches this to his peers in the same group.\
**Priority:** 1

### Didactical method: flipped classroom
**Depends on:** Didactical methods\
**Description:** This is an example of an active method. Pupils need to process the subject matter on their own at home. This opens up time during class to make exercises with a teacher to help. The role of classees and homework are flipped in this didactical method.\
**Priority:** 1

### Describe didactical methods: size of group
**Depends on:** didactical methods\
**Description:** The size of the group can be important for selecting didactical methods. Some didactical methods are good for small class groups, but won't work for bigg gorups (and vice versa). Didactical methods should be annotated with information on for which sizes of groups it is usefull.\
**Priority:** 2

### Describe didactial methods: class setup
**Depends on:** didactial methods
**Description:** How the class is setup, is important. Some didactical methods recquire close communication between students, for others it is important that pupils focus their attention on the teacher. It is usefull to annotate didactical methods/lesson with how the class is setup.
**Priority:** 2
